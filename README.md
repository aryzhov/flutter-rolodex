# Rolodex

A Flutter widget that represents a roll of cards. Useful for indicating a change in a displayed value.
The visual representation is completely customizable, making it usable in a wide range of scenarios, including
the display of time, stock tickers, sensor data, etc.

## Getting Started

```dart

// Without Rolodex
public Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text("$value");
} 
```
